name: title of the movie.
rating: rating given by viewers.
genre: list of genres the movie belongs to.

country:name of country in the movie.
company: name of production company involved in the movie
runtime: duration of the movie in minutes.

## Data source: I got the dataset from kaggle.

## Problem Statement:
Derive insights, trends, correlations, and patterns within the film industry.

## Problem Objectives:
- Which movies have a runtime greater than 180 minutes?
- In which year was the average rating the highest?
- In which year was the average budget the highest?
- What is the average rating of the top 10 directors?
- Which country has the highest total gross?
- Which country has the highest average rating?
- What are the top 10 movies with the highest gross?
- Which genre has the highest total gross?
- What is the correlation between budget and gross?
- Plot a scatter plot of budget versus gross.
- What are the titles and runtimes of the top 10 longest movies?
- How many movies were released in each year?
- What is the most popular movie title with the highest budget and gross?
- What is the most unpopular movie title with the lowest budget and gross?
- What is the highest average gross per year?
- What is the total number of genres for movies released?
- What is the total number of rating categories?

## Data Cleaning steps:
- imported Python libraries
  import numpy as np
  import pandas as pd
  import seaborn as sns
  import matplotlib
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

- read in the data
  df = pd.read_csv("movies.csv")
- view the first 5 rows of the dataset
  df.head()
- display the total rows and columns
  df.shape
- get information about dataset
  df.info()
- get the statistic about the dataset
  df.describe().transpose()
- check for missing value
  df.isnull()
- visualize the value of missing values
  sns.heatmap(df.isnull())
  plt.show()
- view the sum of missing values in the dataset
  df.isnull().sum()
- get the missing value in percentage to be rounded up to 2decimal places
  percent_missing = df.isnull().sum()*100/len(df)
  percent_missing = percent_missing.round(2)
  percent_missing
- drop all missing values
  new_df = df.dropna(axis=0)
  new_df
